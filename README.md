# Windows Phone 8.1 Twitter Custom Panel
Custom panel for windows phone 8.1 (Twitter layout for windows phone). A hack on the twitter for windows phone 8.1 custom control panel header layout. It was created to show a very easy and naive way of creating the custom panel layout which is ever present on the windows phone twitter app. This work is based on simplying this http://depblog.weblogs.us/2013/08/29/twitterate-your-windows-phone-app/. Thanks to Depechie and also the good folks at metro studio http://www.syncfusion.com/ for the icons in this mockup. In the analysis of my version there is a very tiny performance impact due to the creation of textblock objects for which the corresponding path control binds the fill property to the textblock's foreground colour. But it's somewhat negligible in most use cases.

Enjoy!


P.S: Please send me a pull request if you can further simply or improve it.
